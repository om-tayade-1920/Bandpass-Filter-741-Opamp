## ðŸ“Œ Project Aim
To design and implement a Band-Pass Filter using two 741 operational amplifiers (op-amps).

## ðŸ§ª Apparatus Required
- 2 Ã— IC 741 Operational Amplifiers
- 2 Ã— Potentiometers (1 MÎ© each) To Get Band As Per Requirement of User.
- Resistors: 1 kÎ©, 10 kÎ©, 100 kÎ©
- Capacitors: 1000 pF, 100 pF
- Function Generator
- Dual DC Power Supply (Â±15V)
- Breadboard or PCB and Connecting Wires

## ðŸ§  Theory
A band-pass filter allows signals within a specific frequency range to pass, while attenuating others. This design includes:
- A High-Pass Filter (HPF)
- A Low-Pass Filter (LPF)

Both use active op-amp configurations for better gain and control.

## ðŸ§® Calculations
- **HPF Cutoff (fa)**: ~159 Hz
- **LPF Cutoff (fb)**: ~16 kHz
- **Final Gain (dB)**: ~41.36 dB

## ðŸ’» Simulation

We simulated the circuit using **NI Multisim**. You can open the file below using Multisim (version 13 or above):

- [bandpass_filter_simulation.ms14](bandpass_filter_simulation.ms14)

The simulation demonstrates the correct band-pass behavior of the designed circuit.


## ðŸ”§ PCB Implementation
